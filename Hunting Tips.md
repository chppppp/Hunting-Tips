14. Payload to test XSS,SQLI and CSTI
  * ' "<svg/onload=prompt(5);>{{7*7}} 
    
15. Extract Subdomains for ip range with nmap
  * nmap IP_range_sn | grep "domain" | awk'{print $5}' 
  
16. if you trying IDOR in APIs and got 401,403 you can try :
  * {"id":[1234]}
  * {"id":{"id":1234}}
  * url?id=real_id&id=victm
  * {"id":"*"}
  
  17. If we have domain like example.com try to make mail with
      max@example.com if there is no validation to the email maybe
      it's give you access or privileges

 20. trik to get uuid of any user try to register with the same username or email may be uuid will leak on the resbonse.
 
 21. [dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) is a FREE domain research tool that can discover hosts related to a domain. Finding visible hosts    from the attackers perspective is an important part of the security assessment process!!!
 
 22. [UDP Port Scanner](https://www.ipvoid.com/udp-port-scan/)
 
 23. Maybe company uses deffrent domains or maybe there are applications on other domains so we can use "Copy Right Singture" on google  (**intext:"Facebook © 2019"**)
 
 24. If an app uses markdown (xss) : click here (**javascript:alert(1)**)
 
 25. If you found "limit" parameter (**/page?limit=10**) you can try to change it
     to long value like (**/page?limit=9999999999999**) --> layer 7 dos atack
     
 26. When you test for SSRF try to change **HTTP/1.1** to **HTTP/0.9**and
     remove the host header (to bypass some fixes and validations)
     
 27. Run UDP scan if port 500 is open run (**ike-probe**) to see if it's vulnerable to Shared Secret Hash Leakage Weakness
 
 28. If you wanna bypass cloudflare protection and find the origin ip try [WhoIsRequest](https://whoisrequest.com/history/)  and check the Domain history data
 
 29. You can enumerate directories in some buckets with Wfuzz
 > http(S)://**bucket-name-address-here**/FUZZ/
 
 and check the 200 status code without content

32. In url you can try those circumvents: 
  * https://expected-host@evil-host
  * https://evil-host#expected-host
  * https://expected-host.evil-host
  * You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code
  
33. There are some endpoints shows json with the (**content type: Text/html**) CHANGE it to </br> (**Content Type : application/json**)
